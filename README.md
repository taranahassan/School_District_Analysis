## School Analysis Results
Firstly we removed all the scores for grade 9 students for Thomas High School which was a total of 461 students.  The following are the effects of the new analysis.
  
  1.  The District Summary was barely affected with the revision on student numbers.  The grade 9 students at Thomas High School amounted to 1.17% of the total district student population.  The difference for average math and reading scores plus the percentages of students passing math and reading was a low of 0.1%.  Below are the snapshots of the summary before and after the changes.

  2.  There are a total of 1635 students for Thomas High School.  73% of the students are from grade 10th to 12th.  Once we eliminated the grade 9 scores, the percentage of students passing each subject or both together dropped by an average of 26%, since the calculation was still taking the total number students into account.  However, after recalculating the number of students with scores at Thomas High School, the passing percentages barely changed by an average of .37%.  Below are the snapshots of the summary with the highlighted field.
  
  3.  Based on the revised analysis with the 9th grade scores replaced and the overall passing percentage sitting at 65%, it would have placed Thomas High School within the bottom 10 schools, placing them at the 8th position.  However once the scores were replaced and taking the grade 9's out of the equation, the school falls within the top 5 performers, placed 2nd on the list as the original analysis.  
  
  4.  Replacing the grade 9 scores:
    a)  Didn't affect the math and reading scores for grade 10 to 12.  And the average for all 9th graders for math and reading scores barely changed as well since the number of 9th graders in Thomas High School is less than half a percent compared to the total grade 9's for all high schools.
    b)  The spending summary didn't change as well.
    c)  The school size summary didn't change at all.
    d)  the school type summary didn't change at all.
